This report is prepared for an online store that is testing a new payment funnel. The A/B test runs for 3 weeks with around 2600 participants. The goal is to see if within 14 days of signing up, users will show better conversion into product page views (the product_page event), product cart views (product_cart) and purchases (purchase). At each of the stage of the funnel product_page → product_card → purchase, there will be at least a 10% increase.

This repository includes:
- Complete A/B test analysis report in the notebook
- Presentation in PDF
